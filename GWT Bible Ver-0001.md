According to the Golden World Tree Bible, we are issuing tokens to recruit environmental guardians who protect the world. In this campaign, we are looking for our superheroes. If you have the wizard-like ability to protect this world, join us now!

We believe that environmental organizations should operate on a non-profit basis. However, existing environmental organizations have raised concerns about the transparency of their funding. As a solution, we came up with the combination of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

So, we decided to combine the environment with superheroes to create a serious yet not boring organization. We believe that people who think about, support, and donate to the environment are superheroes who protect the earth.

First, we will create Twitter and tokens, and form a DAO. When our supporters reach a certain level, we will put our ideas into action.

The first branch of the Golden World Tree is recruiting superheroes with wizard-like abilities. The total token issuance is 2,387,800,800,000,000 GWT, calculated in minutes of the earth's age.

The purchase and sale commission is 15%. Of this, 5% is used for liquidity, 5% for marketing and development, and 5% for decentralized reflection. Currently, only small-scale split sales are available on a first-come, first-served basis.

The second branch of the Golden World Tree is a joint campaign with environmental organizations to plant trees to prevent desertification. In this campaign, you can play the role of a superhero. Let's plant trees together to become environmental guardians and protect the earth through the Golden World Tree, creating a sustainable environment. We want to create a culture of protecting the earth together and make it possible for everyone to participate in this effort.

We will issue tokens and form a DAO so that all participants can contribute to this project. Our goal is to conduct various campaigns to create a sustainable environment and work with environmental organizations to protect the earth.

Through the Golden World Tree, we want everyone to be able to play the role of a superhero. We welcome all who want to participate in our efforts to protect the environment. Let's become environmental guardians together and create a better future by protecting the earth.
